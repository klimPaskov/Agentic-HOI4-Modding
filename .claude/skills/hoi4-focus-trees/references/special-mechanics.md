# HOI4 Focus Trees: Special mechanics and shared trees

Part of the [hoi4-focus-trees](../SKILL.md) skill. Read before tying focuses to a country mechanic, balance of power or faction rules, building a mechanic GUI or focus inlay, or sharing a tree between countries.

## 5.9 Special mechanics, values, and faction rules

Large focus trees should interact with the event or country special mechanic. A major tree should not sit beside the mechanic without changing it.

Special mechanic values can include:

- legitimacy
- authority
- influence
- faction cohesion
- command obedience
- public panic
- regional control
- military readiness
- industrial capacity
- corruption
- foreign penetration
- religious authority
- revolutionary zeal
- balance-of-power position
- league cohesion
- sponsor pressure

Focuses should affect mechanic values directly when the country has such a mechanic. Political focuses can change legitimacy, balance of power, party strength, faction cohesion, or authority. Industry focuses can change industrial capacity, construction pressure, resource control, or economic recovery. Military focuses can change readiness, command obedience, recruitment, or defensive preparedness. Diplomacy focuses can change influence, recognition, sponsor pressure, faction cohesion, or foreign penetration. Expansion focuses can change threat, legitimacy, claims, resistance, local support, or faction goals.

Mechanic values should unlock or block content and create gameplay consequences. Values should affect focuses, decisions, missions, events, advisors, leaders, laws, factions, war goals, reforms, crises, or endings.

Important internal struggles should consider a balance of power or equivalent mechanic. Good balance-of-power conflicts include army versus parliament, factory councils versus ministries, monarchists versus republicans, foreign patrons versus national independence, security service versus civilian cabinet, or cult authority versus military command. Focuses and decisions should push the balance and unlock branch content, risks, leaders, laws, advisors, or events.

When a focus tree creates or leads a faction, league, bloc, compact, coalition, or alliance, that faction needs goals and rules. Define membership conditions, joining logic, refusal logic, expulsion logic where relevant, war goals, shared decisions, AI behavior, victory conditions, and failure conditions. Important event-created factions should usually have a mechanic such as cohesion, shared command, war council support, joint reserves, recognition, member confidence, sponsor pressure, or strategic goals.

Factions should not form too easily. Define minimum membership, crisis conditions, ideological compatibility, war pressure, diplomatic preparation, and regional logic.


## 5.10 Mechanic presentation, validity, and shared-tree rules

Special mechanics must be visible somewhere the player can understand them. A mechanic can appear in a decision category header, custom scripted GUI, progress meter, scripted localisation tooltip, focus tooltip, national spirit tooltip, or a combination of these.

When a mechanic is important enough for a custom scripted GUI, consider visual presentation beyond static text. Useful presentation can include progress bars, meter fill variants, state icons, status frames, warning frames, selected and locked variants, animated frames, or frame-by-frame visual changes that make the mechanic feel alive. The visuals should clarify the mechanic, not clutter it.

Special mechanics may hide future surprises. Basic cause and effect must remain clear. The player should understand why a visible value rose or fell, which public action changed it, and what broad type of response is available.

When a mechanic must remain visible while the player reads and chooses focuses, use a focus inlay window only when it materially improves tree-local decisions. Verify the current vanilla `focus_inlay_windows` syntax and precedent, reserve its footprint before final coordinates, and keep the inlay aligned with its GUI container and `inlay_window` tree attachment. It must not cover focuses, connectors, filters, Focus Navigation controls, or continuous focuses, and must update from real state with readable tooltips and visibility rules. Use `hoi4.focus_render` plus `hoi4.gui_inspect`/`hoi4.gui_render` for tree and inlay evidence; a clean focus graph alone is insufficient.

AI strategy must respect route validity. AI should not pick a branch that requires a missing state, dead sponsor, non-existent faction, unavailable ideology, disabled evolution, impossible border, or absent enemy. Invalid routes should be hidden, bypassed, or weighted to zero.

Every new playable country package needs a specific identity, starting problem, political direction, map role, military style, economy, diplomacy, AI behavior, and at least one mechanic or decision family that makes it play differently from other new countries.

Shared trees are allowed, but they must be adapted. Shared trees need country-specific localisation, route names, decisions, AI weights, leaders, rewards, icons, and scripted localisation where relevant. If every country using a shared tree reads and plays the same, the tree has failed.

When a route changes leader, ideology, faction, cosmetic name, flag, advisor roster, or special mechanic identity, the focus-tree spec and implementation should account for the needed visible assets and whether they are reused, sourced, generated, or blocked.

Important mechanic thresholds, caps, gains, losses, duration bands, AI weights, and scaling values should be centralized in script constants or a clearly documented tuning file. Do not scatter magic numbers across focus files, decisions, events, scripted effects, and scripted triggers.
